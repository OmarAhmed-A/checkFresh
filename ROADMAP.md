# CheckFresh Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: MVP Development (Core Functionality)

### Step 1: Model Setup and Conversion
- [ ] Convert FinalModel.96.8.h5 to TensorFlow.js format
- [ ] Add TensorFlow.js dependencies to package.json
- [ ] Create model loading utilities
- [ ] Test model loading and basic prediction

### Step 2: Camera Integration
- [ ] Add expo-camera dependency
- [ ] Implement camera permissions
- [ ] Create camera capture component
- [ ] Test camera functionality on device

### Step 3: Image Processing Pipeline
- [ ] Create image preprocessing utilities
- [ ] Implement image resizing to 224x224
- [ ] Add pixel normalization
- [ ] Test preprocessing with sample images

### Step 4: Prediction Integration
- [ ] Connect camera capture to model prediction
- [ ] Implement prediction results parsing
- [ ] Create basic results display
- [ ] Test end-to-end prediction flow

### Step 5: Basic UI
- [ ] Create main prediction screen
- [ ] Add capture button and results display
- [ ] Implement loading states
- [ ] Add basic error handling

## Phase 2: Enhancement (After MVP Confirmation)

### Step 6: UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Improve visual design
- [ ] Add animations and transitions
- [ ] Enhance accessibility
- [ ] Optimize for different screen sizes

### Step 7: Advanced Features
- [ ] Add prediction confidence display
